# Contributing to Lux

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Lux!

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lux-db/lux.git
cd lux
cargo build --release
```

Run the server:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

## Running tests

```bash
cargo test --all-targets
```

## Running benchmarks

Lux vs Redis side-by-side benchmark (requires `redis-benchmark` and `redis-server`):

```bash
./bench.sh
```

## Before you start

- **Open an issue first** for anything beyond small bug fixes. This saves everyone time if the approach needs discussion.
- Check the [open issues](https://github.com/lux-db/lux/issues) for things to work on. Issues labeled `good first issue` or `help wanted` are great starting points.

## Pull requests

- Keep PRs focused. One feature or fix per PR.
- Use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/): `fix:`, `feat:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `ci:`, `chore:`.
- Make sure `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings` passes.
- Make sure `cargo test` passes.
- Add tests for new commands when possible.

## Adding new Redis commands

1. Add the command handler in `src/cmd.rs`
2. Add the store operation in `src/store.rs`
3. Add snapshot serialization/deserialization in `src/snapshot.rs` if it involves a new data type
4. Update the command list in `README.md`
